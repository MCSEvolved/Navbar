# MCS Evolved React Template
Use this template as a template for all the MCSE apps, if you want to build using react of course ;)

## Steps
- Change title (index.html)
- Change path (app.tsx and href in TopNavBar.tsx)
- Add logo in center (TopNavBar)
- Add url (with the new path) to auth0 as valid callback
